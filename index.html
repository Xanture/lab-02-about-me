    <p id="intro">
      My earliest memory of computers was in 4th grade when my elementary teacher introduced our class to quick basic. On my free time, I made my first pick your own adventure game. Short after I built my very first computer. In High school, I assisted in setting up the Network for my school in California. What began as a hobby has turned into a passion that is continuing to shape my future.
