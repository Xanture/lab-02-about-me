      <p>I've always enjoyed discovering, repairing and creating things mechanically. As far back as I can remember I was taking things apart and putting them back together. From power tools, to computers and eventually cars, trucks, and large equipment in the military. If philosophy was a religion, then logic would be its bible. The tool to unlocking lifes mysteries. Even humans are just complex machines and the more we understand the things we create, the more we can understand ourselves.</p>
